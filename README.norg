  /Counter of sells and 'IPV' organizer./


** *Main Idea* >>
   - A single page program to keep track of sells in a calm and clean way.


** _PSEUDO_ >>
   .      *Take input of elements*                                         .
   ( /make this the home page and add a 'DONE' button that redirects to the
   table of elements/ )
   ..     *Create table of elements*                                       .
   ...    *Add functionality to augment or decrement the element count*    .
   ( /the augmentation has to be in a fresh page always to have a clear look
   of what to input/ )
   ....   *Add functionality to add new items*                             .
   .....  *Add a log page to check the order/s if lost*                    .
   ...... *Make a total count of the sells*                                .
   ( /make this a page of the total of each element at the end of the day/ )
   (( /add a total for the price eventually/ ))
